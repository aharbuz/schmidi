# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The slide mode — the feeling of chords emerging from converging glissandos rather than being struck, with the behavior visible and configurable in real-time
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Audio Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Audio Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 5 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-18 — Completed 01-02 (Audio engine core)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 8%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 10min
- Total execution time: 20min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Audio Foundation | 2 | 20min | 10min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 15min, 5min
- Trend: improving

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Electron + Web Audio over pure web — desktop resources, lower latency
- Pre-roadmap: Visualization as primary UI — the sliding tracks ARE the instrument
- Pre-roadmap: Manual track count for v1 — auto-calculation deferred to v2
- 01-01: Used @tailwindcss/postcss instead of @tailwindcss/vite -- Forge Vite plugin CJS bundling cannot load ESM-only modules
- 01-01: Pinned @electron-forge/plugin-vite to exact 7.11.1 (experimental API stability)
- 01-01: ESLint v10 flat config instead of legacy .eslintrc format
- 01-02: Anti-click AudioParam protocol: cancelScheduledValues -> setValueAtTime (anchor) -> ramp/target for all gain changes
- 01-02: Persistent oscillators always running, gain controls audibility -- avoids click/pop from start/stop
- 01-02: Envelope decay/release use setTargetAtTime with timeConstant=period/3 for ~95% convergence
- 01-02: Hard silence setValueAtTime(0) at release*1.67 to prevent lingering near-zero oscillation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Convergence math (simultaneous N-track arrival from arbitrary mid-ramp positions) has no reference implementation — flag for `/gsd:research-phase` during Phase 3 planning
- Phase 1: Electron autoplay behavior (2025/2026) needs integration testing on both macOS and Windows — LOW confidence source
- Phase 4: Canvas performance above 4 tracks unconfirmed — profile in Phase 4 before Phase 5
