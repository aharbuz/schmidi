# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The slide mode — the feeling of chords emerging from converging glissandos rather than being struck, with the behavior visible and configurable in real-time
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Audio Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Audio Foundation)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Electron + Web Audio over pure web — desktop resources, lower latency
- Pre-roadmap: Visualization as primary UI — the sliding tracks ARE the instrument
- Pre-roadmap: Manual track count for v1 — auto-calculation deferred to v2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Convergence math (simultaneous N-track arrival from arbitrary mid-ramp positions) has no reference implementation — flag for `/gsd:research-phase` during Phase 3 planning
- Phase 1: Electron autoplay behavior (2025/2026) needs integration testing on both macOS and Windows — LOW confidence source
- Phase 4: Canvas performance above 4 tracks unconfirmed — profile in Phase 4 before Phase 5
