# Roadmap: Schmidi

## Overview

Schmidi is built from the audio foundation up: correct oscillator architecture and AudioContext patterns first, then a playable chord instrument in synth mode, then the slide mode convergence engine (the load-bearing core differentiator), then the visualization that makes the sliding tracks visible, and finally the configuration personality that makes the instrument expressive and tuneable. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability. Nothing ships until it sounds right.
