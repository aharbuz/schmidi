## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Verifier Score | Status | Gaps | Anti-Patterns |
|-------|---------------|--------|------|---------------|
| 1. Audio Foundation | 5/5 truths | passed (human_needed) | 0 | 0 |
| 2. Chord Engine + Synth Mode | 5/5 criteria | passed (human_needed) | 0 (closed by 02-05) | 0 |
| 3. Convergence Engine + Slide Mode | 13/13 must-haves | passed (human_needed) | 0 (closed by 03-05, 03-06) | 0 |
| 4. Visualization | 8/8 must-haves | passed | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Instrument Personality | 21/21 must-haves | passed | 0 (wiring fix 861adfb) | 0 |

**Total must-haves verified:** 52/52
**Total anti-patterns:** 0

Note: Phases 1-3 have "human_needed" status because audio perceptual tests require runtime listening. All code wiring is verified correct. Phase 5 human verification was completed explicitly (all 4 success criteria confirmed by user).

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | From | To | Status |
|-------------------|------|-----|--------|
| Shared masterGain | Phase 1 | Phase 2, 3 | WIRED |
| Chord routing (anchor + slide) | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | WIRED |
| Track state polling (60fps) | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | WIRED |
| Canvas overlay + dimming | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | WIRED |
| Personality configs → engine | Phase 5 | Phase 3 | WIRED |

**Exports wired:** 18/18
**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Launch → Splash → Start → Synth → Play chords | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Toggle slide → Visualization → Chord → Convergence → Release | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Switch presets (Eerie/Bloom/Swarm) → Different characters | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Toggle idle modes (Silent/Quiet/Drone) → Behavior changes | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Enable scale snap → Stepped convergence | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Switch views (Radial/Waveform) → Audio uninterrupted | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Full-viz mode → Play chords → Escape to exit | COMPLETE |

**Complete:** 7/7
**Broken:** 0

## Tech Debt

Minor documentation inconsistencies only — no code debt:

- ROADMAP.md has unchecked plan boxes for Phase 1 (01-02 through 01-05) and Phase 3 (03-05, 03-06) despite all plans being executed and verified
- ROADMAP.md progress table shows Phase 1 as "In Progress" and Phase 3 as "Gap Closure" despite both being complete
- Phases 1-3 VERIFICATION.md status is "human_needed" for audio perceptual tests (code wiring is confirmed correct in all cases)

**Total tech debt items:** 3 (documentation only)
**Code-level debt:** 0

## Build & Test

- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)
- Tests: 130/130 passing (9 test files)
- ESLint: 0 warnings
- Pre-commit hook: typecheck + lint enforced

## Milestone Definition of Done

The v1.0 milestone delivers a convergence synthesizer with:
1. Correct audio engine architecture (persistent oscillators, anti-click scheduling)
2. Playable chord instrument in synth mode
3. Core Schmidi mechanic: converging glissandos that arrive simultaneously at chord targets
4. Real-time visualization as primary instrument interface
5. Configurable instrument personality (presets, idle modes, cycle behavior, scale snap)

All 22 v1 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases complete. All cross-phase integration verified. All E2E flows working.
