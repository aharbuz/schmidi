# Continue: Verify Phase 1 White Screen Fix

## Summary
Found and fixed the true root cause of the Phase 1 white screen bug. It was NOT a silent ES module failure — it was a race condition in Electron Forge's Vite plugin where `loadURL` fires before the Vite dev server is accepting TCP connections (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`).

## What was done
1. Read through entire source code — all modules are clean, no top-level throws
2. Tested in standalone Vite dev server (`npx vite`) — full UI works perfectly (splash + instrument)
3. Added file-based debug logging to main process (stdout unreliable with electron-forge)
4. Debug log revealed: `DID-FAIL-LOAD: -102 ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED http://localhost:5173/`
5. Added `loadURLWithRetry()` with exponential backoff in main.ts
6. Cleaned up all diagnostic code

## Current state
- `loadURLWithRetry()` is in place and committed
- User has NOT yet confirmed the fix works (they need to run `npm start` and verify)
- Phase 1 human verification checkpoint still pending

## Next steps
1. **User runs `npm start`** and confirms splash screen appears
2. User clicks "Click to Start" and verifies full instrument UI
3. If working: complete Phase 1 verification (all controls, keyboard, presets)
4. Mark Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2 planning

## Key file paths
- Fix: `src/main/main.ts` — `loadURLWithRetry()` function
- Entry HTML: `index.html`
- App root: `src/renderer/App.tsx`
- Progress: `AGENTS/context-in/PROGRESS.md`
