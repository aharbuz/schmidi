# Continue: Phase 5 — Complete Execute-Phase Workflow

## Summary of work done
Phase 5 execution + debugging session:
1. Executed all 3 plans (05-01, 05-02, 05-03) across 3 waves — 7 code commits
2. User tested → found SLIDE-07/08/09 broken (store-to-engine wiring bug)
3. Fixed 3 missing engine calls in synthStore.ts + scale freq build on toggle
4. Wrote 43 tests (presets + scale frequencies) — 130/130 pass
5. User re-tested → all 4 success criteria confirmed
6. Fixed dropdown focus hijacking UX issue

## Current state
- All Phase 5 code committed and pushed
- User confirmed SLIDE-06 ✓, SLIDE-07 ✓, SLIDE-08 ✓, SLIDE-09 ✓
- **Phase 5 checkpoint approved** but execute-phase workflow not completed
- Missing: 05-03 SUMMARY.md, verifier run, roadmap/state updates, phase marked complete

## Next steps (complete the execute-phase workflow)
1. Create `.planning/phases/05-instrument-personality/05-03-SUMMARY.md` (from executor template)
2. Update STATE.md with 05-03 completion
3. Update ROADMAP.md with plan progress (`roadmap update-plan-progress`)
4. Aggregate results across all 3 plans
5. Run gsd-verifier for phase goal verification
6. If passed: mark phase complete (`phase complete 05`), update roadmap/state
7. Offer next via `/gsd:progress`

Note: The execute-phase workflow was interrupted by the checkpoint + debug cycle. The remaining steps are the post-wave completion workflow (aggregate → verify → complete).
