# Continue: Phase 2 Gap Closure Plan Ready

## Work Done
- Ran `/gsd:plan-phase 2 --gaps` to create a gap closure plan for Phase 2's one remaining verification gap
- Planner created `02-05-PLAN.md` — wires per-track volume sliders to functional per-degree audio routing
- Plan checker found 1 blocker: `Voice.ts` missing from `files_modified` and `<context>`
- Revision fixed the blocker (added Voice.ts to both locations)
- Plan verified and ready for execution

## Current State
- Phase 2 has 5 plans: 02-01 through 02-04 (complete), 02-05 (gap closure, ready to execute)
- Gap: Success criterion #5 — "User adjusts per-track volume sliders and individual track levels change independently"
- All other 4 success criteria verified passing
- 87 tests pass, TypeScript clean

## Next Steps
1. `/gsd:execute-phase 2` — execute plan 02-05 (gap closure)
2. Re-verify Phase 2 after execution
3. Then proceed to Phase 3 planning (`/gsd:discuss-phase 3`)

## Key File Paths
- `.planning/phases/02-chord-engine-synth-mode/02-05-PLAN.md` — gap closure plan
- `.planning/phases/02-chord-engine-synth-mode/02-VERIFICATION.md` — verification report with gap details
- `src/renderer/audio/ChordVoiceManager.ts` — needs per-degree GainNodes
- `src/renderer/audio/Voice.ts` — needs `reconnect()` method
- `src/renderer/store/synthStore.ts` — needs perTrackVolumes state + action
- `src/renderer/components/PerTrackVolume.tsx` — needs controlled inputs wired to store
