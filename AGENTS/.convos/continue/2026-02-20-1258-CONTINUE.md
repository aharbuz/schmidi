# Continue: Phase 4 Visualization Planning

## Work Done
- Ran `/gsd:discuss-phase 4` — captured implementation decisions for the Visualization phase
- Created `.planning/phases/04-visualization/04-CONTEXT.md` with decisions on radial view, waveform trace, layout, and convergence payoff
- Committed as `docs(04): capture phase context`

## Current State
- Phase 4 context gathered, ready for planning
- Phase 3 has 2 remaining gap closure plans (03-05, 03-06) not yet executed
- Phases 1-2 complete, Phase 3 core complete

## Next Steps
1. `/gsd:plan-phase 4` — create detailed plans for the visualization phase (user confirmation needed — user may want to finish Phase 3 gap closures first)

## Key Files
- `.planning/phases/04-visualization/04-CONTEXT.md` — phase 4 decisions
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — overall project roadmap
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — VIZ-01 through VIZ-04
