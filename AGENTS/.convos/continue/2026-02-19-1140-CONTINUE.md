# Continue: Phase 3 UAT In Progress

## Work Done
- Started Phase 3 UAT (verify-work) session
- Created 03-UAT.md with 8 tests derived from 4 SUMMARY files
- Test 1 (Mode Toggle): PASSED — but user noted slide engine audio bleeds into synth mode at startup
- Logged startup audio bleed as a gap (severity: major)

## Current State
- UAT session is active, paused at Test 2 (Idle Track Motion)
- 1/8 tests completed, 7 pending
- 1 gap logged (slide audio audible in synth mode at startup)

## Next Steps
1. Resume UAT: `/gsd:verify-work 3` will detect active session and resume from Test 2
2. Complete remaining 7 tests
3. If issues found: auto-diagnose, plan fixes, verify fix plans
4. Then: `/gsd:execute-phase 3 --gaps-only` to fix issues

## Key Files
- UAT file: `.planning/phases/03-convergence-engine-slide-mode/03-UAT.md`
- Phase dir: `.planning/phases/03-convergence-engine-slide-mode/`
- State: `.planning/STATE.md`
