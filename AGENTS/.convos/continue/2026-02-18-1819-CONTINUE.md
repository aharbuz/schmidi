# Continue: Phase 2 Execution

## Summary
Phase 2 (Chord Engine + Synth Mode) is fully planned with research and verification complete. 4 plans in 3 waves ready for execution.

## Current State
- Phase 2 planned: `.planning/phases/02-chord-engine-synth-mode/` has 4 PLAN.md files + RESEARCH.md + CONTEXT.md
- Phase 1 human verification checkpoint still pending (01-05 Task 3)
- All Phase 1 code is working (33 Vitest, 3 Playwright, tsc clean)

## Next Steps
1. `/gsd:execute-phase 2` — build the chord instrument (4 plans, 3 waves)
   - Wave 1: music theory engine + voice pool (parallel)
   - Wave 2: store + UI components
   - Wave 3: app layout integration + keyboard + verification checkpoint
