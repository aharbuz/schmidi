# Continue: Debug White Screen in Phase 1 App

## Summary
Phase 1 execution completed all 5 plans, but the app shows a white screen. Debugging session narrowed the cause.

## Root cause identified
- A minimal React App (no imports) renders fine — "React is working!" in cyan
- The full App.tsx with 12+ component imports causes a silent ES module failure
- ES modules fail silently when any import in the chain throws — no console error
- Root `index.html` was also missing the CSS `<link>` tag (fixed, committed)

## Next steps
1. **Binary-search the failing import**: Comment out half the imports in App.tsx, test, narrow down which component/module crashes
2. Likely culprits to check first:
   - `window.schmidiAPI` access in TitleBar.tsx or SplashScreen.tsx (preload bridge)
   - Audio engine modules that reference `AudioContext` at import time
   - Any top-level code that runs during module evaluation (not just in React lifecycle)
3. Once the failing import is found, fix the root cause (likely a missing null check or browser API guard)
4. Resume human verification checkpoint for plan 01-05

## Debugging approach
```
// In App.tsx, comment out imports in groups:
// Group A: store, hooks (synthStore, useAudioInit, useAnimationLoop)
// Group B: components (SplashScreen, TitleBar)
// Group C: instrument components (VoiceButton, WaveformSelector, ADSRControls, EnvelopeCurve)
// Group D: monitoring components (VolumeControl, Oscilloscope, StatusBar)
// Group E: audio constants
```

## Key file paths
- Entry HTML: `index.html` (root — this is what Vite serves)
- Duplicate HTML: `src/renderer/index.html` (NOT used by Vite — can be removed)
- App root: `src/renderer/App.tsx`
- Components: `src/renderer/components/`
- Audio engine: `src/renderer/audio/`
- Store: `src/renderer/store/synthStore.ts`

## Notes
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` is ESM-only — can't use with Forge's CJS config (same as `@tailwindcss/vite`)
- Vite's esbuild JSX transform works fine without the React plugin
- The `git stash` contains diagnostic changes if needed: `git stash pop`
