# Continue: Phase 1 Verification Checkpoint

## Summary of work done
Executed all 5 plans of Phase 1 (Audio Foundation) via `/gsd:execute-phase 1`. All code is committed, all automated tests pass (33 Vitest, 3 Playwright), TypeScript compiles, ESLint passes.

## Current state
- **Paused at:** Plan 01-05, Task 3 — human verification checkpoint
- The executor agent for 01-05 returned checkpoint state (agent ID: `a5bb137`)
- All 5 plan SUMMARYs exist in `.planning/phases/01-audio-foundation/`
- STATE.md and ROADMAP.md have been updated through plan 01-05

## Next steps
1. **Resume the verification checkpoint**: User needs to run `npm start`, test the app, and type "approved" or describe issues
2. After approval, spawn a continuation agent for plan 01-05 to create the final SUMMARY and update state
3. Run the phase verifier (`gsd-verifier` agent)
4. Mark phase complete in ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
5. Proceed to `/gsd:plan-phase 2` (Chord Engine + Synth Mode)

## How to resume
Run `/gsd:execute-phase 1` — the workflow will detect completed SUMMARYs for plans 01-01 through 01-04, find 01-05 incomplete (no SUMMARY.md yet), and resume from the checkpoint.

Alternatively, manually complete the checkpoint:
1. Verify the app works (`npm start`)
2. Type "approved"
3. The orchestrator needs to spawn a continuation agent for 01-05 with `user_response = "approved"`
