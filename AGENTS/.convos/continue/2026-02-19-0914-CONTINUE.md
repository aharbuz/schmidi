# Continue: Phase 3 Context Captured

## Work Done This Session

Ran `/gsd:discuss-phase 3` for **Phase 3: Convergence Engine + Slide Mode**.

Conducted a deep discussion across all four gray areas:
1. **Idle behavior** — all movement modes, range types, correlation, boundary handling, speed, pitch quantization — all configurable, prune-after-hearing strategy
2. **Convergence feel** — identified the core architecture fork (heat-seekers vs spawn-overflow hybrid), resolved note assignment (distance-optimized), convergence timing, easing, mid-convergence behavior
3. **Volume envelope** — proximity-driven swell, anticipatory swell, configurable curve/floor/held-level/fade, master limiting, global (not per-track)
4. **After convergence** — hold duration, departure direction, landing bounce, micro-motion, auto-cycle — all configurable

Key decision: Phase 3 implements **Model A (heat-seekers) + Model C (spawn-overflow hybrid)**, toggleable. Model B (pure spawn-and-die) deferred.

## Current State

- Phase 2 complete (all 5 plans incl. gap closure)
- Phase 3 context gathered and committed: `.planning/phases/03-convergence-engine-slide-mode/03-CONTEXT.md`
- No RESEARCH.md or PLAN.md yet for Phase 3

## Next Steps

Run in a fresh context window:

```
/gsd:plan-phase 3
```

This will:
1. Spawn a researcher to investigate convergence math, Web Audio API scheduling for simultaneous N-track arrival, and glissando patterns
2. Spawn a planner to create executable PLAN.md files based on the research and CONTEXT.md decisions

## Key File Paths

- Context: `.planning/phases/03-convergence-engine-slide-mode/03-CONTEXT.md`
- Roadmap: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- State: `.planning/STATE.md`
- Phase 2 audio engine reference: `src/renderer/audio/` (ChordVoiceManager, Voice, VoiceManager)
- Store reference: `src/renderer/store/synthStore.ts`
