# Continue: Phase 5 Execution — Human Verification Checkpoint

## Summary of work done
Executed `/gsd:execute-phase 5` (Instrument Personality). All 3 plans across 3 waves completed code execution:

- **05-01** (Wave 1): Preset system, scale frequency utilities, store extensions — 2 tasks, 3 commits
- **05-02** (Wave 2): Engine behaviors — cycle mode, idle modes, drone layer, scale-snapped convergence — 2 tasks, 3 commits
- **05-03** (Wave 3): UI layer — preset overlay, advanced controls, silent mode dimming — Task 1 complete (1 commit), Task 2 (human-verify checkpoint) pending

## Current state
- All code committed (7 commits total on main)
- Plan 05-03 is at a **human-verify checkpoint** (Task 2)
- The executor agent returned checkpoint state — needs continuation after user verification
- No SUMMARY.md for 05-03 yet (created after checkpoint passes)
- STATE.md and ROADMAP.md were updated by 05-01 and 05-02 executors but NOT yet for 05-03

## Next steps

1. **Present the checkpoint to user** — 19 verification steps covering SLIDE-06/07/08/09:
   - SLIDE-06: Preset buttons on canvas, distinct characters, intensity slider, auto-custom
   - SLIDE-07: Hold mode stays, Cycle mode breathes
   - SLIDE-08: Silent (dimmed orbs, no sound), Quiet Sliding, Ambient Drone
   - SLIDE-09: Scale-snapped glissando, staircase convergence, scale picker

2. **After user says "approved"** — spawn a fresh gsd-executor continuation agent for 05-03:
   - Task 1 already committed (`b137c15`)
   - Resume from Task 2 with user_response = "approved"
   - Agent creates SUMMARY.md, updates STATE.md and ROADMAP.md

3. **After 05-03 completes** — continue the execute-phase workflow:
   - Aggregate results across all 3 plans
   - Run gsd-verifier for phase goal verification
   - If passed: mark phase complete, update roadmap, offer next

4. **If user reports issues** — spawn continuation with issue description, route to gap closure

## Resuming the execute-phase workflow
The orchestrator was at the "execute_waves" step, Wave 3, waiting for checkpoint resolution. After checkpoint is resolved and 05-03 completes, continue to `aggregate_results` → `verify_phase_goal` → `update_roadmap` → `offer_next`.
